### Framework

- Find the optimal substructure that satisfies: can be solved first and then proceed to the rest.
- Prove that there is always an optimal solution based on greedy selection.
- Prove that current subquestion is as the same as the rest of subquestions.


Unlike dynamic programming, greedy algorithm always chooses the most current optimal solution.
